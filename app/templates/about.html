    <h2>COVID-19 University Simulator </h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px">About: A simulation tool for analyses of COVID-19 control in a university setting, by evaluating alternative combinations of mass test rate, contact trace and test rate, transmission rate (probability of transmission per contact per day), and contact rate (number of contacts per person per day). Transmission rate can be used for representation of face mask use and physical distancing practices. Contact rate can be used for representation of scheduling. The simulation tool also provides options for inputting population size, start and end day of simulation, initial infections on day of reopening school, infections per day from contacts with outside university population, condition for initiating trace and test in terms of number of diagnosed cases, and unit costs of testing and quarantine. Outcomes include epidemic metrics: deaths, hospitalizations, new diagnosis, number of cases (diagnosed and diagnosed); and resource need metrics: number trace and tests, number mass tests, number quarantines, and total costs. Other simulation metrics are available in the Excel file that can be downloaded after the simulation runs. 
     <h3>Use Simulator: <span style="font-size:18px">
    <p Follow 'Instructions and Guide' on Home page for setting-up the scenarios. After setting-up scenarios, click 'Run Simulation'. See results and downloadable Excel file on 'Simulation Results' </p>
